</details>

<details><summary><b>Use Project Creator CLI</b></summary>

The 'project-creator-cli' tool can be used to create applications from a CLI terminal or from within batch files or shell scripts. This tool is available in the *{ModusToolbox&trade; install directory}/tools_{version}/project-creator/* directory.

Use a CLI terminal to invoke the 'project-creator-cli' tool. On Windows, use the command-line 'modus-shell' program provided in the ModusToolbox&trade; installation instead of a standard Windows command-line application. This shell provides access to all ModusToolbox&trade; tools. You can access it by typing "modus-shell" in the search box in the Windows menu. In Linux and macOS, you can use any terminal application.

The following example clones the "[mtb-example-btstack-threadx-hello-sensor](https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-example-btstack-threadx-hello-sensor)" application with the desired name "HelloSensor" configured for the *CYW955513EVK-01* BSP into the specified working directory, *C:/mtb_projects*:

   ```
   project-creator-cli --board-id CYW955513EVK-01 --app-id mtb-example-psoc6-hello-world --user-app-name HelloSensor --target-dir "C:/mtb_projects"
   ```



The 'project-creator-cli' tool has the following arguments:

Argument | Description | Required/optional
---------|-------------|-----------
`--board-id` | Defined in the <id> field of the [BSP](https://github.com/Infineon?q=bsp-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--app-id`   | Defined in the <id> field of the [CE](https://github.com/Infineon?q=ce-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--target-dir`| Specify the directory in which the application is to be created if you prefer not to use the default current working directory | Optional
`--user-app-name`| Specify the name of the application if you prefer to have a name other than the example's default name | Optional

> **Note:** The project-creator-cli tool uses the `git clone` and `make getlibs` commands to fetch the repository and import the required libraries. For details, see the "Project creator tools" section of the [ModusToolbox&trade; tools package user guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) (locally available at {ModusToolbox&trade; install directory}/docs_{version}/mtb_user_guide.pdf).

</details>

## Steps to enable BTSpy logs

1. Navigate to the application Makefile and open it. Find the Makefile variable `ENABLE_SPY_TRACES` and set it to the value *1* as shown:
    ```
    ENABLE_SPY_TRACES = 1
    ```
2. Save the Makefile, and then build and program the application to the board.

3. Launch the [BTSpy](https://github.com/Infineon/btsdk-utils/tree/master/BTSpy) tool.

4. Open the [ClientControl](https://github.com/Infineon/btsdk-host-apps-bt-ble/tree/master/client_control) application and make the following settings:
   - Set the baud rate to 3000000.
   - Deselect flow control.
   - Select the serial port and click on an open port.

## Operation
1. Connect the board to your PC using the provided USB cable through the KitProg3 USB connector.

2. Start the ClientControl and BTSpy applications using the steps from the section above, but do not open any serial port.

3. Program the board using one of the following:

   <details><summary><b>Using Eclipse IDE</b></summary>

      1. Select the application project in the Project Explorer.

      2. In the **Quick Panel**, scroll down, and click **\<Application Name> Program (KitProg3_MiniProg4)**.
   </details>


   <details><summary><b>In other IDEs</b></summary>

   Follow the instructions in your preferred IDE.
   </details>


   <details><summary><b>Using CLI</b></summary>

     From the terminal, execute the `make program` command to build and program the application using the default toolchain to the default target. The default toolchain is specified in the application's Makefile but you can override this value manually:
      ```
      make program TOOLCHAIN=<toolchain>
      ```

      Example:
      ```
      make program TOOLCHAIN=GCC_ARM
      ```
   </details>

4. After programming, the application starts automatically. Open the serial port using the ClientControl application to observe the messages/HCI traces on the BTSpy application. Wait for the device to connect with the peer client (for example, the AIROC&trade; Bluetooth&reg; Connect App). Use the BTSpy to view the Bluetooth&reg; stack and application trace messages in the terminal window.

5. To test using a Hello Client peer application, follow these steps:

   - Ensure that you have programmed Hello Client to another supported BSP and the application is advertising with the name **Hello Client**.

   - Press the user button on Hello Client to start scanning for the Hello Sensor and connect to it automatically.

   - Press the user button and connect with more Hello Sensor devices, one at a time. The Hello Client application is capable of connecting up to three Hello Sensors.

   - After Hello Client is connected to at least one Hello Sensor it starts advertisement by default if button press is not detected. Using smart phone installed with AIROC&trade; Bluetooth&reg; Connect App; scan for **Hello Client** and issue connection from the phone.

   - After connection and service discovery is complete, you will see three GATT Services. Each service corresponds to Hello Sensors connected to the Hello Client. You can issue 'Read' from AIROC&trade; Bluetooth&reg; Connect App to the Device Name Characteristic of first service to know the device name of the first Hello Sensor connected. You can use the Device Name Characteristic to identify rest of the Hello Sensors connected.

   - Go to Notify Characteristic of a connected Hello Sensor. Click **Read** or **Start Notify** button. This triggers pairing when the phone and Hello Client are not bonded. Accept the pairing request on the phone.

   - You will receive notification from the Hello Sensor through Hello Client to the phone. Press button on the first Hello Sensor and observe the corresponding Notify Characteristic on the phone to get the notification.

6. To test using the AIROC&trade; Bluetooth&reg; Connect App, do the following:

   - Turn on Bluetooth&reg; on your Android or iOS device.

   - Launch the AIROC&trade; Bluetooth&reg; Connect App.

   ![](./images/airoc.png)

   **Figure 2. Testing with the AIROC&trade; Bluetooth&reg; Connect App on Android**

   - Swipe down on the AIROC&trade; Bluetooth&reg; Connect App home screen to start scanning for Bluetooth&reg; LE peripherals; your device ("Hello") appears on the AIROC&trade; Bluetooth&reg; Connect App home screen. Select your device to establish a Bluetooth&reg; LE connection.

   - In the Services page, choose the first characteristic to enable notifications/indications. Register for notifications or indications. This initiates the pairing process.

   - Press the user button 1 in the kit and observe that notification/indication is being received in the mobile app.

   - You can use the Write Characteristic to blink the LED on the Hello Sensor through phone. Choose the Write Characteristic from first service and write a value from 1 - 9 to blink LED on the first Hello Sensor.

7. To forget a bonded device, reset the device.

## Debugging

You can debug the example to step through the code.


<details><summary><b>In Eclipse IDE</b></summary>

Use the **\<Application Name> Debug (KitProg3_MiniProg4)** configuration in the **Quick Panel**. For details, see the "Program and debug" section in the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; user guide](https://www.infineon.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide).

> **Note:** **(Only while debugging)** On the CM4 CPU, some code in `main()` may execute before the debugger halts at the beginning of `main()`. This means that some code executes twice – once before the debugger stops execution, and again after the debugger resets the program counter to the beginning of `main()`. See [KBA231071](https://community.infineon.com/docs/DOC-21143) to learn about this and for the workaround.

</details>


<details><summary><b>In other IDEs</b></summary>

Follow the instructions in your preferred IDE.

</details>


> **Note:** Debugging is of limited value when there is an active Bluetooth&reg; LE connection because as soon as the Bluetooth&reg; LE device stops responding, the connection will get dropped.

## Design and implementation

The code example configures the device as a Bluetooth&reg; LE GAP Peripheral and GATT Server. The example implements a custom GATT service called 'Hello_Sensor' service and has two custom characteristics - Notify and Blink. The Notify Characteristic sends a notification or indication to the peer client device upon button press events. The Blink Characteristic is used by the peer client to write the number of times the onboard user LED should blink.

After reset, the application starts automatically and initializes BTSTACK and other device peripherals. The device starts to advertise its presence to the peer central devices. Aftere a Bluetooth&reg; LE connection is established, the peer client device can register for notifications/indications to be received using the CCCD handle of the Notify Characteristic. Because the CCCD handle of the Notify characteristic requires write authentication, an attempt to enable notification/indication will trigger the pairing process at the Central side. Once the pairing process completes, the peer device's link keys and addresses are stored in the device's flash memory and they are bonded.

The user button on the board is configured to trigger an interrupt on the falling edge. Press and release the button quickly to start undirected high advertisements if no connection exists. If a connection exists and notifications/indications are enabled, sends a notification/indication packet to the peer client device.

The peer client can also write the number of times the user LED on the board blinks using the Blink Characteristic.

## Notes

On the CYW955513EVK-01 boards no flash memory is present. So, all the bonding information along with the downloaded application is lost. After a board reset; application needs to be downloaded again for the board to operational as well as repairing is required with peer devices.

## Resources and settings

This section explains the ModusToolbox&trade; resources and their configurations used in this code example. Note that all the configurations explained in this section have already been implemented in the code example.

- **Device Configurator:** ModusToolbox&trade; stores the configuration settings of the application in the *design.modus* file. This file is used by the Device Configurator that generates the configuration firmware. This firmware is stored in the application's *GeneratedSource* folder.

   By default, all applications in a workspace share the same *design.modus* file i.e., they share the same pin configuration. Each BSP has a default *design.modus* file in the *mtb_shared\TARGET_\<bsp name\>\<version\>\COMPONENT_BSP_DESIGN_MODUS* directory. It is not recommended to modify the configuration of a standard BSP directly.

   To modify the configuration for a single application or to create a custom BSP, see the [ModusToolbox&trade; user guide](https://www.infineon.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserguide). This example uses the default configuration. See the [ModusToolbox&trade; Device Configurator user guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxDeviceConfig).

- **Bluetooth&reg; Configurator:** The Bluetooth&reg; peripheral has an additional configurator called the "Bluetooth&reg; Configurator" that is used to generate the Bluetooth&reg; LE GATT database and various Bluetooth&reg; settings for the application. These settings are stored in the file named *design.cybt*.

   Note that unlike the Device Configurator, the Bluetooth&reg; Configurator settings and files are local to each respective application. The services and characteristics added are explained in the [Design and implementation](#design-and-implementation) section. See the [Bluetooth&reg; Configurator user guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxBLEConfig).
